# Introduction To Simple Array Manipulations
In the previous lab, you learnt how to create arrays and access the elements of an array. Now you are ready to manipulate arrays using different ruby methods.

> Make sure to consult the Official Documentation of the Ruby Language when solving this lab.

## Objectives

1. Become comfortable using the official documentation of the Ruby Language
2. Gain proficiency performing simple array  manipulations
3. Gain proficiency understanding the result of method calls on arrays

## Instructions
Open `spec/intro_to_simple_array_manipulations_spec.rb` and go through each test sequentially.  Be sure to read each test very carefully. You will be filling out your answers in the spec.

Consult the official documentation of the [Ruby Landguage](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.5/) for the methods you need to use to solve the problems in this lab.

As you read the method descriptions, make sure to pay attention to understanding what the result (that is the return object) of calling a particular method on an array is because:

> One of the most common problems you will encounter on your journey to becoming a software developer is not knowing what object a method returns. For example: you might assume that the result of a method call is a string but instead it is an array object that contains a string.
