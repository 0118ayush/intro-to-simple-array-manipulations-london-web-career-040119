# Intro To Simple Array Manipulations


## Objectives
<pop, shift, unshift, insert, concat, uniq, flatten, delete_at -->

1. Gain proficiency
2. Become comfortable using the official documentation of the Ruby Language
3. Gain proficiency manipulating arrays

## Instructions
Open `spec/intro_to_simple_array_manipulations_spec.rb` and go through each test sequentially.  Be sure to read each test very carefully.

Consult the official documentation of the [Ruby Landguage](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.5/) for the methods you need to use to solve the problems in this lab.

As you read the method descriptions, make sure to pay attention to understanding what the result (that is the return object) of calling a particular method on an array is because:
1. One of the most common problems you will encounter as you learn programming is not knowing what object a method returns/assuming that a method returns a particular oject type while it returns a different object type. For example: you think that the result of a method call is a string but instead it is an array object that contains a string.  

You will be filling out your answers in the spec.
